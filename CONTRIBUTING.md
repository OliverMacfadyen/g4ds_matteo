# Contribution guide

Every person involved in the Monte Carlo group is at least registered as a Master.
It means that you are allowed to directly push in the master branch ([more details about permission](https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/help/permissions/permissions "more details about permission")).

In order to avoid any conflict and issues from your local modifications, it is requested to push your work in a development branch and merge with the master branch when developments and tests are complete.
